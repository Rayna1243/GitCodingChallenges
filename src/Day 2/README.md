## Day 2 Exercise (Unit Testing with JUnit 4)

### Before You Begin...

* Make sure that you have installed IntelliJ IDEA CE. This will allow you to open the files found in
`Day 2` with the correct dependencies and file structure

* If this is your first exercise, fork the root repository and clone the repo to your account with 
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/GitCodingChallenges
  ```

* After cloning, make sure the remote is set to your account with:
  ```
  $ git remote -v
  ``` 
  which should return a link to the GitHub repository with your username in it


### Objectives & Tips

* In this exercise you'll be tasked with completing unit tests found in `SpaceshipTest.java`. You may use 
any of the provided files as references for your tests

* There is a test written in the class that may be useful with regard to the setup and assertions expected in
your tests

* Some methods may have more functionality than others, so remember that for every function call within a method,
you are responsible for testing that the call produces the expected output

### Remember...

* Once you have your solution, run your tests in IntelliJ to prove that your solutions work

* To submit your changes, you'll need to `add` all changed files, `commit` your changes, and then `push`

* After your changes are pushed, you'll want to open a pull request (PR) on ```github.com``` in order to 
merge into the original repository (this one)
