### Before You Start
**1.)** Be sure to have installed IntelliJ IDEA CE

**2.)** Pull in most recent changes with ```git pull```
(make sure your origin remote is set to: http://www.github.com/donnelldebnam/GitCodingChallenges) for "fetch" and "push"

**3.)** Open IntelliJ and click File -> Open -> GitCodingChallenges

### Exercise 1
**Task 1:** Find the `Exercise.java` in the `Day 2` directory

**Task 2:** Write tests for the methods found in `Exercise.java` in its corresponding test file (you may find it helpful
to review the existing implementation and test files provided)

**Task 3:** Add, commit, and push all of your changes

**Task 4:** On ``github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/GitCodingChallenges``, submit a new pull request with these new changes
